 My intent with this script is to add another option screen to instant action
 I want to eventually configure options for a new era mod
 "Cross Era" will allow for scenarios like Empire vs Droids, Clones vs Rebels, etc..
 the player will be able to select which sides fight

 To install: copy the Shell Folder into your mod project
 munge with "Shell" checked
 find the shell.lvl in the _LVL_PC folder in your mod project
 rename it to custom_gc_6.lvl
 move it to the game directory: GameData/data/_lvl_pc

 requires the v1.3 patch or higher

NOTE: the cross era sound lvls are not munging, please push a fix

 Thanks, Anakin, BAD_AL, S1thK3nny, SleepKiller, and Rayman1103
